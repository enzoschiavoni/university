This repository contains my university final projects and my academic transcript.

"Implementing_a_self_balancing_robot.pdf" describes how the project was made.
Starting whith a brief despcription of all the components that are part of the robot as its sensors, motors and electronics. Then is analized the diferent physical variables at our disposal, processing them with diferent kind of filters.
The following part shows how we found the robot's mathematical model by classical physics reasoning and laboratory tests to find the values of the phsycal constants. 
The project concludes with the design of a controller to stabilize the robot.

"Robotic_arm_using_computer_vision.pdf" is the final projet of "Introduction to robotics" subject.Were integrated concepts that are behind a robotic arm (Denavitâ€“Hartenberg parameters,forward kinematics and inverse kinematics) with computer vision techniques (using OpenCV library for Python).
